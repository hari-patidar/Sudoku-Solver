# Sudoku-Solver
It is an Non Gui Based Sudoku Solver which is hard coded for a single problem.

The Sudoku Problem is already given as a input in the program and it shows the solution for that problem only.
It uses recursion to solve the problem with efficient time, Specifically it uses Backtracking Algorithm to solve the problem efficiently.


I am currently working on its GUI Development. Also I am trying to add a sudoku game with it to play and then if unable to solve the problem on your own than one can use the solve button or option provided to check the correct solution for the problem.
